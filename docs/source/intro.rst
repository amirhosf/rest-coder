Introduction
============

REST Coder is a collection of tools for auto-generating documentation and client stubs for RESTful web APIs. This release of REST Coder comes with four primary tools.

 * Client stub generators

   * Python client stub generator
   * JavaScript/AJAX client stub generator

 * API doc generators

   * Sphinx API doc generator
   * HTML API doc generator

Each of the above tools take an API description (specification) in JSON format as input. Client stubs generated by REST Coder tools can be embedded in a wide range of desktop, mobile and web applications to consume the target web APIs with or without human intervention. The documentation generated by these tools can be published on the web as reference material for the developers and users. The REST Coder stub generators are primarily designed for application and mashup developers who regularly need to write code that consumes one or more web APIs. The REST Coder documentation generators allow generating high-quality API docs from a given API specification, which allows API providers to publish comprehensive API docs for their APIs, and speed up the release cycles by avoid spending time on manually writing and editing API docs.
